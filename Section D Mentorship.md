# Option 1: Student Progress


- Identify the reasons why the 5 lagging students are behind and provide targeted support to help them catch up. This could involve providing extra one-on-one sessions with the with me, additional resources to help them overcome any obstacles they may be facing.
- Identify the reasons why the 10 at-risk falling behind students are falling to complete the task at hand. Work with the 10 at-risk of falling behind students to set clear expectations and deadlines for completing their next tasks. Provide them with any necessary resources and support to help them meet these deadlines. This could include additional check-ins with the me, peer mentorship: Asking the 5 who are ahead to assits them if they have any questions.
- Provide regular feedback and check-ins for all students to ensure they are on track and staying motivated. This could involve weekly progress reports and frequent communication with students to identify any potential issues or obstacles. An openline of communction with the students will help them.
- Celebrate the progress of the 5 students who are ahead of expected progress and encourage them to continue their hard work. Ensure that they have access to any additional resources or support they may need to maintain their momentum and stay motivated.
- Monitor the progress of all students closely and adjust the intervention plan as necessary. If any student falls further behind, take immediate action to provide additional support and resources to help them get back on track.

Overall, the key to success in this situation will be to provide targeted support and resources to each student based on their individual needs and progress. By closely monitoring progress and providing timely intervention, we can ensure that all students stay on track and graduate successfully.

# Option 2: Java Support Task'

- Clarify the issue: I would ask some questions to better understand the problem they are facing. For instance, I would ask about the specific error message they are getting or the exact behavior they are observing when the program is executed. I would also ask them to describe their code and walk me through the steps they are taking to execute it.
- Review the code: Once I have a better understanding of the issue, I would ask them to share their code with me so that I can review it. This would allow me to identify any syntax errors or logical issues that may be causing the problem.
- Troubleshoot the issue: Based on the information they provide and the code review, I would begin troubleshooting the issue. This could involve debugging the code, testing different approaches, or searching for similar issues online.
- Provide guidance and support: Once I have identified the issue and a potential solution, I would provide guidance and support to help them resolve the problem. This could involve explaining the root cause of the issue, demonstrating how to fix it, or providing additional resources or examples to help them better understand the problem and its solution.
- Follow up: Finally, I would follow up with them to ensure that the issue has been resolved and that they are able to move forward with their project. I would also encourage them to reach out to me or other mentors if they encounter any further issues or need additional guidance or support in the future.

Overall, my goal would be to provide them with personalized support and guidance to help them overcome the technical challenges they are facing and achieve their learning objectives.
