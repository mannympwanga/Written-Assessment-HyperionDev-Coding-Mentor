# Review of Solution's code

## Correctness 2/5
## Efficiency 5/5
## Style 4/5
## Documentation 4/5




## Positive aspects
- The implementation of the Caesar Cipher is correct the is still some syntax error that needs to fixed
- The code has appropriate comments explaining the different sections and the purpose of variables and operations.
- The code is readable and easy to understand due to the use of descriptive variable names and proper indentation.
- The use of TypeScript type definitions is good practice and helps ensure type safety.


## Suggestions for improvement
- Line 7: shift parameter should be of type number instead of string.

- Line 13: let encodedText: string = '' can be written as let encodedText = '' since TypeScript can infer the type of the variable.

- Line 20: if (alphabet[alphabetIndex + shift]) should be changed to if (alphabet[alphabetIndex + shift] !== undefined) to prevent a runtime error if the shift value is too large.

- Line 28: There is no return statement. The function should return encodedText.


- Add support for lower-case alphabets, spaces, and special characters.


- Use more descriptive variable names and const instead of let when appropriate.


- Add comments to explain the function's purpose, inputs, and outputs.


- Consider adding error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-string values or shift values greater than 26.


- The code lacks documentation, which can make it difficult for others to understand the function's purpose and how it works. It's recommended to add comments to explain the function's inputs, outputs, and any other relevant details.


- The code follows TypeScript's style guide and is easy to read and understand. However, some variable names could be more descriptive, such as T and i. It's also recommended to use const instead of let for variables that won't be reassigned.

## Overall Feedback
Overall, the code looks correct in terms of implementing the Caesar Cipher was good. However, some improvements can be made in terms of style and documentation. The variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., string could be changed to inputString or plaintext). The comments could also be expanded to explain each step of the algorithm more clearly. Please fix the syntax errors and resubmit.
